Hi! This is Zyx.

-  I am a Bachelor student at Berklee College of Music.
-  I major in Music Composition for Film, TV, and Games (Berklee Online)
-  For me, music is the ultimate duet of logic and emotion.
-  My interest is algebraic method as a music theory, focusing on symmetry and representation, like that in serialism.
